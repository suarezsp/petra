# FIRST TASK - creating a logic core for the app

I created LogEntry and Anomaly with pydantic. 
These are the basic domain models. Im using pydantic to validate
types automatically (p.e avoiding bugs like timestamp="string")

I made them inmutables, so I cant accidentally change them later 

I created a iface with AnomalyLevels 

# SECOND TASK - basic parser
